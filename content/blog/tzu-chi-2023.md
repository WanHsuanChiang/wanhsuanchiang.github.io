My involvement with Tzu Chi, an organization renowned for its humanitarian work, began as a family practice, focusing on educational donations. This perspective shifted as I learned about Tzu Chi's extensive global outreach, particularly in supporting people in need, regardless of religious affiliations.

A significant chapter in my journey unfolded when my aunt, a dedicated Tzu Chi volunteer, visited me in the Netherlands after completing her mission in Poland. This unexpected family reunion deepened my bond with Tzu Chi's humanitarian ethos, transcending my own religious beliefs.

Relocating to Munich for work, I encountered a housing scam. It was during this challenging time that my aunt introduced me to Susan, a compassionate individual within the Tzu Chi community. Her invaluable support, along with that of other community members, helped me navigate through this crisis. This personal experience underscored the importance of community solidarity and assistance beyond religious or cultural boundaries.

Motivated by a sense of gratitude and a desire to understand the impact of humanitarian work, I participated in Tzu Chi's winter charity events. This mission, aimed at supporting people in need from Poland and Ukraine, highlighted the compassion and solidarity shared by humans across different backgrounds and beliefs.

Particularly moving was my participation in the Eucharist during a collaborative event with Caritas, a Catholic charity organization. As someone who does not adhere to the Buddhist faith of Tzu Chi or the Christian doctrine of Caritas, I found this experience profoundly enlightening. It was a vivid demonstration of how compassion and humanitarian aid transcend religious boundaries, bringing diverse people together in the spirit of universal empathy and support.

This journey with Tzu Chi allowed me to witness firsthand the complexities of international aid and the importance of inter-religious cooperation. The experience challenged my perspectives on structured organization, youth engagement in charity, and the need for adaptability in humanitarian efforts.

Reflecting on this journey, I realize that supporting those in need knows no religious bounds. While I may still be seeking answers to many questions, this experience with Tzu Chi has been a significant step in my journey towards understanding and practicing universal compassion and empathy.
